# Raster Data Processing Techniques

#### What is Raster Data?
- **Raster data** represents information about the Earth's surface as a grid of cells (pixels), where each cell stores a value that represents a feature or attribute.

#### Raster Data Processing Techniques
- **Image Resampling**: Adjusting the resolution of an image by rescaling pixels. Useful for aligning images with different resolutions or merging images of different sizes.
  
- **Image Enhancement**: Techniques to improve the quality or interpretability of images, such as contrast enhancement, sharpening, and color balancing.

- **Image Mosaicking**: Combining multiple images to create a seamless composite image of a larger area. Essential for creating continuous coverage over large regions.

- **Geometric Correction**: Adjusting satellite images to correct distortions caused by Earth's curvature and satellite sensor position. Includes orthorectification for accurate geographic representation.

- **Atmospheric Correction**: Removing atmospheric effects (such as scattering and absorption) from satellite images to improve the accuracy of remote sensing data analysis.

- **Noise Removal**: Filtering techniques to reduce unwanted variations in image data caused by sensor noise, interference, or environmental factors.
