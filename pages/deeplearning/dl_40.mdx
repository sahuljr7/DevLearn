# Real-World Projects Using Sentinel Data

#### 1. Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS)

- **Objective**: Provide timely and accurate geospatial information for emergency response.
- **Description**: The EMS uses Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to map disaster-affected areas, such as floods, earthquakes, and landslides. This service supports disaster management authorities by offering rapid mapping and detailed analysis.
- **Impact**: Enhanced emergency response capabilities, better planning, and resource allocation during disasters.

#### 2. Sen2-Agri

- **Objective**: Support agricultural monitoring and land use mapping.
- **Description**: The Sen2-Agri system utilizes Sentinel-2 data to generate crop type maps, crop status reports, and vegetation indices. It provides high-resolution, timely information to support sustainable agricultural practices.
- **Impact**: Improved agricultural monitoring, yield prediction, and food security.

#### 3. Global Surface Water Explorer

- **Objective**: Monitor changes in global surface water bodies over time.
- **Description**: This project uses Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to map and analyze changes in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs worldwide. The data helps track water availability, usage, and the impact of climate change.
- **Impact**: Better water resource management, environmental monitoring, and climate change studies.

#### 4. Urban Atlas

- **Objective**: Provide detailed mapping of urban land use and land cover.
- **Description**: Urban Atlas utilizes Sentinel-2 data to produce high-resolution maps of urban areas across Europe. The project supports urban planning, infrastructure development, and environmental management.
- **Impact**: Improved urban planning, sustainable development, and environmental protection.

#### 5. Land Cover and Land Use Mapping

- **Objective**: Generate accurate and up-to-date land cover and land use maps.
- **Description**: Sentinel-2 data is used to create detailed maps that classify different land cover types, such as forests, agriculture, water bodies, and urban areas. These maps are essential for environmental monitoring and land management.
- **Impact**: Enhanced land use planning, natural resource management, and environmental conservation.

#### 6. Global Forest Watch

- **Objective**: Monitor global forest cover and detect deforestation.
- **Description**: Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data are used to track changes in forest cover, detect illegal logging, and monitor forest health. The platform provides near-real-time data and alerts to support forest conservation efforts.
- **Impact**: Improved forest conservation, illegal logging detection, and biodiversity protection.

#### 7. Air Quality Monitoring

- **Objective**: Measure and analyze air pollution levels.
- **Description**: Sentinel-5P data is used to monitor air quality by measuring concentrations of pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and ozone. The data supports public health initiatives and environmental policies.
- **Impact**: Better air quality management, public health protection, and policy-making.

#### 8. Marine Monitoring

- **Objective**: Monitor ocean and coastal environments.
- **Description**: Sentinel-3 data is used to observe sea surface temperature, ocean color, and sea surface height. This information is crucial for marine ecosystem monitoring, fisheries management, and climate studies.
- **Impact**: Enhanced marine resource management, climate change research, and environmental protection.

#### 9. Crop Monitoring for Food Security

- **Objective**: Improve food security through better crop monitoring.
- **Description**: Sentinel-2 data is used to monitor crop growth, assess crop health, and predict yields. The information helps farmers and policymakers make informed decisions to ensure food availability.
- **Impact**: Improved agricultural productivity, food security, and sustainable farming practices.

#### 10. Coastal Change Monitoring

- **Objective**: Monitor coastal erosion and land use changes in coastal areas.
- **Description**: Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data are used to track changes in coastal regions, including shoreline erosion, land reclamation, and habitat changes. The data supports coastal management and conservation efforts.
- **Impact**: Enhanced coastal management, disaster preparedness, and habitat conservation.
