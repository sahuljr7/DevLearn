# Data Preprocessing Steps

#### Atmospheric Correction
- **Purpose**: Corrects satellite images for atmospheric disturbances such as haze, aerosols, and Rayleigh scattering.
- **Methods**: Algorithms like Sen2Cor for Sentinel-2 data use specific models to estimate and remove atmospheric effects.
- **Importance**: Enhances the accuracy of spectral analysis and improves the consistency of satellite data for comparative studies.

#### Geometric Correction
- **Purpose**: Adjusts satellite images to remove distortions caused by Earth's curvature and sensor position.
- **Techniques**: Orthorectification involves projecting images onto a standardized map coordinate system using terrain models and satellite sensor parameters.
- **Benefits**: Ensures spatial accuracy and alignment of images, essential for precise geographic analysis and mapping.

#### Resampling
- **Purpose**: Adjusts the spatial resolution of satellite images to match other data or analysis requirements.
- **Methods**: Interpolation techniques like nearest-neighbor, bilinear, or cubic convolution are used to compute new pixel values based on existing ones.
- **Considerations**: Trade-offs between resolution enhancement and potential loss of information or introduction of artifacts should be balanced based on specific application needs.

#### Image Registration
- **Purpose**: Aligns multiple satellite images or different sensor bands to a common coordinate system.
- **Methods**: Uses control points or tie points to match corresponding features between images, ensuring spatial consistency.
- **Applications**: Facilitates image fusion, change detection, and multi-temporal analysis by enabling accurate pixel-to-pixel comparison.

#### Quality Assessment
- **Purpose**: Evaluates the reliability and usability of satellite data for intended applications.
- **Criteria**: Includes parameters such as radiometric accuracy, sensor calibration status, cloud cover percentage, and image metadata completeness.
- **Actions**: Data with low quality indicators may be filtered out or undergo further preprocessing steps to mitigate inaccuracies.

#### Data Normalization
- **Purpose**: Adjusts the range or distribution of pixel values in satellite images to standardize data for consistent analysis.
- **Techniques**: Normalization methods like min-max scaling or z-score normalization are applied to enhance the comparability of different image datasets.
- **Benefits**: Improves the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms by reducing the influence of data variability and enhancing model training convergence.
