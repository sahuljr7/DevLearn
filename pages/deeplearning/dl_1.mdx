# Overview of satellite imaging

#### What is Satellite Imagery?
- **Satellite imagery** refers to pictures of Earth or other planets taken from satellites in space.
- These images are used for various purposes like mapping, environmental monitoring, and disaster management.

#### Types of Satellite Images
- **Multispectral**: Captures data at different wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum. Useful for observing vegetation, water bodies, and urban areas.
- **Hyperspectral**: Captures hundreds of narrow spectral bands. Provides detailed information about the materials present in the scene.
- **Radar (Synthetic Aperture Radar - SAR)**: Uses radio waves to capture images. Can penetrate clouds and is useful for all-weather imaging.

#### Sentinel Satellites
- **Sentinel-1**: Provides radar imagery for land and ocean monitoring.
- **Sentinel-2**: Captures multispectral images with high spatial resolution. Useful for land monitoring, agriculture, and forestry.
- **Sentinel-3**: Focuses on ocean and land monitoring, providing data for climate monitoring and weather forecasting.

#### Applications of Satellite Imagery
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Tracking changes in forests, water bodies, and glaciers.
- **Urban Planning**: Mapping urban areas and monitoring infrastructure development.
- **Disaster Management**: Assessing the impact of natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes.
- **Agriculture**: Monitoring crop health, estimating yields, and managing resources.

#### Key Concepts
- **Resolution**: The level of detail in the image. Includes spatial (size of the smallest object), spectral (number of wavelength bands), temporal (frequency of image capture), and radiometric (sensitivity of the sensor).
- **Georeferencing**: Aligning satellite images with geographic coordinates so they can be used with maps and other spatial data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Steps to prepare satellite images for analysis, such as correcting atmospheric effects, removing noise, and aligning images from different dates.

#### Tools and Software
- **QGIS**: Open-source geographic information system for viewing and analyzing spatial data.
- **SNAP (Sentinel Application Platform)**: Software specifically designed for processing Sentinel satellite data.
