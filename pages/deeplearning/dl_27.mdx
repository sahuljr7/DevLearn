# Introduction to object detection

- **Object Detection Basics:**
  - **Definition:** Identifying and locating objects of interest within satellite images.
  - **Applications:** Urban planning, disaster response, agriculture monitoring.

- **Challenges:**
  - **Resolution:** Satellite images often have lower resolution compared to traditional photos.
  - **Variability:** Images can vary in lighting, weather conditions, and angles.

- **Techniques Used:**
  - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Primary tool for feature extraction and detection.
  - **Region-based CNNs:** Divide image into regions, classify each for potential objects.
  - **Anchor Boxes:** Predicts regions likely to contain objects based on predefined sizes and shapes.

- **Datasets:**
  - **Annotated Datasets:** Labeled images used to train models (e.g., COCO dataset).
  - **Domain-Specific Datasets:** Tailored datasets for specific satellite image applications.

- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - **Intersection over Union (IoU):** Measures overlap between predicted and actual object regions.
  - **Mean Average Precision (mAP):** Average precision across all object categories.

- **Applications in Sentinel Data:**
  - **Vegetation Monitoring:** Detecting changes in agricultural areas.
  - **Urban Development:** Tracking construction and infrastructure changes.
  - **Disaster Response:** Identifying affected areas and damaged infrastructure.

- **Future Trends:**
  - **Integration with AI:** Combining object detection with AI for real-time analysis.
  - **Improving Resolution:** Advances in satellite technology improving image clarity.
  - **Automated Analysis:** Moving towards fully autonomous satellite image analysis systems.
