# Fundamentals of Remote Sensing

### What is Remote Sensing?
- **Definition**: The process of collecting information about an object or area from a distance, typically using satellites or aircraft.
- **Purpose**: To observe and measure physical properties without direct contact.

### Key Principles
- **Electromagnetic Radiation (EMR)**:
  - **Definition**: Energy that travels through space in the form of waves.
  - **Sources**: Sun (natural) and artificial sources (e.g., radar).
  - **Interaction with Objects**: EMR can be absorbed, transmitted, or reflected by objects.

- **Spectral Bands**:
  - **Visible Light**: Wavelengths visible to the human eye (400-700 nm).
  - **Infrared**: Beyond visible light, used for heat detection.
  - **Microwave**: Used in radar remote sensing.

- **Resolution**:
  - **Spatial Resolution**: The size of the smallest object that can be detected (e.g., 10 meters).
  - **Spectral Resolution**: The ability to distinguish between different wavelengths.
  - **Temporal Resolution**: How frequently data is collected for the same area.
  - **Radiometric Resolution**: The sensitivity of the sensor to detect slight differences in energy.

### Remote Sensing Process
1. **Data Acquisition**:
   - **Sensors**: Instruments on satellites or aircraft that collect data.
   - **Platforms**: Vehicles carrying sensors (e.g., satellites, drones).

2. **Data Processing**:
   - **Preprocessing**: Correction of sensor errors, atmospheric effects, and geometric distortions.
   - **Image Analysis**: Techniques like classification, change detection, and image enhancement.
   - **Post-Processing**: Converting processed data into useful information (e.g., maps, reports).

### Applications of Remote Sensing
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Tracking changes in land cover, vegetation, and water bodies.
- **Agriculture**: Monitoring crop health, soil conditions, and irrigation.
- **Disaster Management**: Assessing damage from natural disasters and planning recovery efforts.
- **Urban Planning**: Analyzing urban growth, infrastructure development, and land use patterns.
