# Introduction to Sentinel Satellite Data

### What is Sentinel Satellite Data?
- **Sentinel Satellites**: A series of Earth observation satellites launched by the European Space Agency (ESA) under the Copernicus program.
- **Purpose**: To provide comprehensive and high-resolution data for environmental monitoring and disaster management.

### Types of Sentinel Satellites
- **Sentinel-1**:
  - **Type**: Radar imaging (SAR - Synthetic Aperture Radar).
  - **Features**: All-weather, day-and-night imaging.
  - **Uses**: Monitoring land and sea, detecting oil spills, and mapping changes after natural disasters.
- **Sentinel-2**:
  - **Type**: Multispectral imaging.
  - **Features**: High-resolution optical imaging with 13 spectral bands.
  - **Uses**: Agriculture, forestry, land cover classification, and disaster monitoring.
- **Sentinel-3**:
  - **Type**: Ocean and land monitoring.
  - **Features**: Measures sea surface topography, sea and land surface temperature, and ocean color.
  - **Uses**: Climate monitoring, marine environment monitoring, and land surface analysis.
- **Sentinel-5P**:
  - **Type**: Atmospheric monitoring.
  - **Features**: Measures air quality, ozone, and trace gases.
  - **Uses**: Air pollution monitoring and climate research.

### Key Features of Sentinel Data
- **Free and Open Access**: Available to users worldwide at no cost.
- **High Resolution**: Provides detailed images for precise analysis.
- **Regular Revisit Times**: Frequent data updates, with some satellites revisiting the same location every few days.
