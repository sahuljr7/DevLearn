# Introduction to Change Detection

**Change Detection Basics**:
- **Definition**: Identifying changes in land cover, vegetation, urbanization, etc., over time using satellite images.
- **Purpose**: Monitor environmental changes, urban development, deforestation, disaster assessment, etc.

**Types of Change Detection**:
1. **Bi-temporal Change Detection**: Comparing two images from different times.
   - Example: Pre- and post-disaster images.
2. **Multi-temporal Change Detection**: Analyzing multiple images over time.
   - Example: Seasonal changes in vegetation.

**Key Steps in Change Detection**:
1. **Image Acquisition**: Obtain satellite images from sources like Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, or Landsat.
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - **Radiometric Correction**: Adjust for sensor and atmospheric distortions.
   - **Geometric Correction**: Align images to a common coordinate system.
3. **Image Differencing**: Subtract pixel values of one image from another.
   - **Thresholding**: Define a threshold to classify changes.
4. **Post-classification Comparison**: Classify each image independently and compare the results.
5. **Machine Learning Approaches**: Use algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, or deep learning models for more complex change detection tasks.

**Challenges**:
- **Noise and Disturbances**: Cloud cover, shadows, and seasonal variations can affect accuracy.
- **Data Availability**: Frequent and high-resolution images are needed for detailed analysis.

**Applications**:
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Track changes in forests, wetlands, and water bodies.
- **Urban Planning**: Observe urban expansion and infrastructure development.
- **Disaster Management**: Assess impact and recovery after natural disasters like floods or earthquakes.
- **Agriculture**: Monitor crop health, growth stages, and land use changes.

**Tools and Techniques**:
- **Remote Sensing Software**: Use tools like Google Earth Engine, QGIS, or ArcGIS.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Apply advanced CNNs, RNNs, or transformers for precise change detection.
