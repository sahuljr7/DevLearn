# Introduction to Raster Data and Its Structure

### What is Raster Data?
- **Definition**: A type of geospatial data representing information as a grid of cells or pixels.
- **Structure**: Each pixel contains a value representing a specific attribute (e.g., elevation, temperature) at a particular location.

### Key Concepts

- **Resolution**:
  - **Spatial Resolution**: Size of each pixel on the ground (e.g., 10 meters, 30 meters).
  - **Temporal Resolution**: Frequency of data capture over time (e.g., daily, monthly).

- **Attributes**:
  - **Single-band**: Represents one attribute per pixel (e.g., grayscale elevation model).
  - **Multi-band**: Contains multiple attributes per pixel (e.g., RGB bands in satellite imagery).

- **Coordinate Reference System (CRS)**:
  - **Definition**: Mathematical framework for locating and representing positions on the Earth's surface.
  - **Importance**: Ensures accurate spatial referencing and alignment with other geospatial data.
