# Techniques for Change Detection in Satellite Images

**1. Image Differencing**:
- **Definition**: Subtract pixel values of one image from another taken at different times.
- **Process**:
  - Align images using geometric correction.
  - Calculate difference for each pixel.
  - Apply threshold to identify significant changes.
- **Use Case**: Quick and simple change detection like disaster impact assessment.

**2. Image Ratioing**:
- **Definition**: Divide pixel values of one image by the corresponding pixel values of another.
- **Process**:
  - Ratio each pixel value from one image with the corresponding pixel value from the other.
  - Highlight areas with significant ratio differences.
- **Use Case**: Detect subtle changes in vegetation or water bodies.

**3. Change Vector Analysis (CVA)**:
- **Definition**: Measure the magnitude and direction of changes in pixel vectors in a multi-spectral space.
- **Process**:
  - Calculate the change vector for each pixel.
  - Analyze the magnitude and direction of these vectors.
- **Use Case**: Detailed analysis of multi-spectral changes, such as land cover change.

**4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
- **Definition**: Reduce dimensionality of data and highlight change by transforming the data to principal components.
- **Process**:
  - Combine multi-temporal images into a single dataset.
  - Apply PCA to transform the data.
  - Identify changes using principal components.
- **Use Case**: Extract significant changes from noisy data.

**5. Post-classification Comparison**:
- **Definition**: Classify each image independently and then compare the classifications.
- **Process**:
  - Classify each image into different land cover classes.
  - Compare classifications to identify changes.
- **Use Case**: Detailed land use and land cover change detection.

**6. Multi-temporal Composite Analysis**:
- **Definition**: Combine multiple images over time to detect changes.
- **Process**:
  - Create composite images from multiple time periods.
  - Analyze composites for changes over time.
- **Use Case**: Seasonal changes and long-term environmental monitoring.

**7. Machine Learning Techniques**:
- **Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM)**:
  - Train classifiers on labeled change and no-change areas.
  - Predict changes on new images.
- **Deep Learning (CNN, RNN)**:
  - Use deep learning models to learn complex patterns and changes.
  - Apply models to detect changes automatically.
- **Use Case**: High-accuracy change detection in complex environments.

**8. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Differencing**:
- **Definition**: Use NDVI to monitor vegetation changes.
- **Process**:
  - Calculate NDVI for images from different times.
  - Subtract NDVI values to identify changes in vegetation.
- **Use Case**: Agricultural monitoring and forest cover changes.

**9. Object-based Change Detection**:
- **Definition**: Detect changes based on image objects rather than individual pixels.
- **Process**:
  - Segment images into meaningful objects.
  - Compare objects over time for changes.
- **Use Case**: Urban development and infrastructure changes.
