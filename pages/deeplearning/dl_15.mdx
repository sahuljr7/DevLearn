# Basics of Deep Learning and Neural Networks

#### What is Deep Learning?
- **Definition**: Subset of machine learning involving algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, known as artificial neural networks (ANNs).
- **Key Concept**: Learns from large amounts of data to recognize patterns and make decisions without explicit programming.

#### Neural Networks
- **Neurons**: Basic units that process and transmit information in artificial neural networks.
- **Layers**: Networks organized in layers (input, hidden, output) where data flows through interconnected nodes (neurons).
- **Activation Function**: Non-linear function that determines if a neuron should be activated based on input.

#### Training a Neural Network
- **Training Data**: Input-output pairs used to teach the network to make predictions.
- **Loss Function**: Measures how well the network's predictions match the actual outputs.
- **Optimization**: Adjusts network parameters (weights and biases) to minimize the loss using algorithms like gradient descent.

#### Deep Learning Applications
- **Image Classification**: Assigning labels to images based on their content (e.g., identifying land cover types in satellite imagery).
- **Object Detection**: Identifying and locating objects within images (e.g., detecting buildings or vehicles in aerial photographs).
- **Segmentation**: Partitioning images into meaningful segments for detailed analysis (e.g., delineating land use boundaries).

#### Tools and Frameworks
- **TensorFlow**: Open-source library for building and deploying machine learning models, including deep learning.
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework known for its flexibility and ease of use, widely used in research and production.
