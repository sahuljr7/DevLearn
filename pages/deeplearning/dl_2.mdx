# Types of Satellite Images

### 1. Multispectral
- **Definition**: Images captured at different wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum.
- **Bands**: Typically 3-10 bands, including visible and near-infrared.
- **Uses**: Agriculture (crop health), land cover classification, environmental monitoring.

### 2. Hyperspectral
- **Definition**: Captures a wide range of wavelengths, often hundreds of narrow bands.
- **Bands**: 100-200+ bands.
- **Uses**: Mineralogy, precision agriculture, detecting subtle changes in vegetation.

### 3. Radar
- **Definition**: Uses radio waves to capture images.
- **Advantages**: Can see through clouds and works in the dark.
- **Uses**: Topographic mapping, disaster monitoring (e.g., floods, earthquakes).

## Deep Learning for Sentinel Raster Images and Satellite Images

### Key Concepts

- **Sentinel Satellites**: Part of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Copernicus program. Provides high-resolution images for various applications.
- **Raster Images**: Digital images represented by a grid of pixels, each with a value representing information such as light intensity or spectral reflectance.

### Applications of Deep Learning

1. **Image Classification**:
   - **Objective**: Categorize each pixel or region into different classes (e.g., water, forest, urban areas).
   - **Techniques**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used.

2. **Object Detection**:
   - **Objective**: Identify and locate specific objects within an image (e.g., ships, buildings).
   - **Techniques**: Use of advanced CNNs like YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Faster R-CNN.

3. **Change Detection**:
   - **Objective**: Identify changes in a particular area over time using images from different dates.
   - **Techniques**: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks can be used.

4. **Image Segmentation**:
   - **Objective**: Partition an image into segments that represent different objects or areas.
   - **Techniques**: U-Net and Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) are popular choices.

### Challenges and Considerations

- **Data Quality**: Ensuring high-quality, cloud-free images.
- **Data Volume**: Handling large volumes of data requires robust storage and processing capabilities.
- **Model Generalization**: Ensuring models work well across different geographic regions and times.
