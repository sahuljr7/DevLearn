# GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication)

## Introduction

GSM is a widely used standard for digital cellular communication. It provides voice and data services to mobile devices and enables users to communicate wirelessly over a cellular network.

## History

GSM was developed in the 1980s by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) to replace analog cellular systems. It became the dominant global standard for mobile communication and paved the way for modern digital cellular networks.

## Architecture

GSM architecture consists of several components:
- **Mobile Station (MS)**: Mobile device used by the subscriber.
- **Base Station Subsystem (BSS)**: Includes Base Transceiver Station (BTS) and Base Station Controller (BSC).
- **Network Switching Subsystem (NSS)**: Includes Mobile Switching Center (MSC), Visitor Location Register (VLR), and Home Location Register (HLR).
- **Authentication Center (AuC)**: Provides security functions.
- **Equipment Identity Register (EIR)**: Maintains information about mobile device identities.

## Specification

### Access Methods

- **Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)**: GSM uses TDMA to divide the frequency spectrum into time slots, allowing multiple users to share the same frequency channel.
- **Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)**: Each user is assigned a unique frequency channel within a cell.

### Frequency Bands

- GSM operates in various frequency bands, including 900 MHz and 1800 MHz.

### Channel Spacing

- Channel spacing in GSM is typically 200 kHz.

### Duplex Distance

- GSM uses a duplex distance of 45 MHz in the 900 MHz band and 95 MHz in the 1800 MHz band.

### Addressing

- **IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity)**: Unique identifier for mobile devices.
- **IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity)**: Unique identifier for subscribers.
- **MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number)**: Phone number of the subscriber.
- **MSRN (Mobile Station Roaming Number)**: Temporary number assigned to a roaming subscriber.
- **LAI (Location Area Identity)**: Identifies a location area within the network.
- **TMSI (Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity)**: Temporary identifier assigned to a subscriber to protect privacy.
- **LMSI (Local Mobile Subscriber Identity)**: Identifier used within a location area.
- **CI (Cell Identity)**: Identifies a specific cell within the network.

## Call Flow in GSM

### PSTN to Mobile Phone
1. Call initiated from PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network).
2. Call routed to Mobile Switching Center (MSC).
3. MSC queries Home Location Register (HLR) for subscriber information.
4. Call routed to Base Station Controller (BSC).
5. BSC instructs Base Transceiver Station (BTS) to page mobile phone.
6. Mobile phone responds, call established.

### Mobile Phone to Mobile Phone
1. Similar to PSTN to Mobile Phone, but both mobile phones involved.
2. Call routed between MSCs and BSCs of respective subscribers.
3. Handover may occur if mobile phones move between cells during the call.

### Mobile Phone to PSTN
1. Similar to Mobile Phone to Mobile Phone.
2. Call routed to PSTN via MSC.
3. Connected to destination phone.

## Services of GSM

- Voice calls, SMS (Short Message Service), MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service), Data services (GPRS, EDGE).

## Security

- GSM provides encryption of voice and data communications to ensure privacy and security.
- Authentication and encryption algorithms are used to verify subscriber identity and protect communication.

## Billing

- GSM networks keep track of subscriber usage for billing purposes, including call duration, data usage, and value-added services.

## Mobile Phones

- GSM-compatible mobile phones support voice and data communication over GSM networks.
- Various features and capabilities, including call management, messaging, internet access, and applications.
