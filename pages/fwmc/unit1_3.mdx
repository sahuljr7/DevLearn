# Elements of Electronic Communication System in Foundation Course in Wireless and Mobile Communication

## Transmitter

- **Definition**:
  - Device that converts the information into electrical signals suitable for transmission.
- **Functions**:
  - Signal processing: Modulation, amplification, and filtering.
  - Conversion: Converts information into electrical form.
  - Transmission: Transfers the signal to the transmission medium.

## Transmission Medium

- **Definition**:
  - Physical path through which the signal travels from transmitter to receiver.
- **Types**:
  - Guided Media: Transmission occurs through a physical medium, such as copper wires or optical fibers.
  - Unguided Media: Transmission occurs through free space, such as air or vacuum, using electromagnetic waves.

## Receiver

- **Definition**:
  - Device that receives the transmitted signal and converts it back into the original form of information.
- **Functions**:
  - Demodulation: Extracts the original information from the modulated carrier signal.
  - Amplification: Boosts the received signal strength.
  - Signal Processing: Filtering and decoding.

## Noise Source

- **Definition**:
  - Any unwanted disturbance that interferes with the communication process.
- **Types**:
  - External Noise: Originates from sources external to the communication system, such as atmospheric noise or man-made interference.
  - Internal Noise: Generated within the system components, such as thermal noise in electronic circuits.

## Channel

- **Definition**:
  - Medium through which the signal is transmitted from the transmitter to the receiver.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Attenuation: Reduction in signal strength as it travels through the channel.
  - Distortion: Alteration of the signal waveform due to factors like multipath propagation.
  - Noise: Interference that degrades the quality of the transmitted signal.

## Feedback

- **Definition**:
  - Mechanism by which a portion of the output signal is fed back to the input of the system.
- **Purpose**:
  - Stability: Helps maintain system stability by adjusting system parameters.
  - Control: Allows for regulation and optimization of system performance.
  - Compensation: Minimizes errors and distortions introduced by the communication system.

## Conclusion

Understanding the elements of an electronic communication system is essential for designing, analyzing, and optimizing wireless and mobile communication networks. Each component plays a vital role in the transmission and reception of information, while considerations such as noise and feedback influence system performance and reliability.
