# Historical Perspective in Foundation Course in Wireless and Mobile Communication

## Early Developments

- **19th Century**: 
  - James Clerk Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism laid the foundation for wireless communication.
  - Heinrich Hertz demonstrated the existence of radio waves in the late 19th century.
- **Marconi's Contribution**:
  - Guglielmo Marconi pioneered the practical application of wireless telegraphy.
  - Conducted the first successful transatlantic radio transmission in 1901.

## Evolution of Wireless Communication

- **Wireless Telegraphy**:
  - Early use of Morse code for long-distance communication via radio waves.
- **Voice Communication**:
  - Invention of the vacuum tube facilitated voice transmission.
  - Development of amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM).
- **Mobile Telephony**:
  - Bell Labs introduced the concept of cellular networks in the 1940s.
  - Launch of the first commercial mobile telephone service in 1946 (MTS).

## Milestones in Mobile Communication

- **First Generation (1G)**:
  - Introduced in the 1980s.
  - Analog systems with limited capacity and voice-only communication.
- **Second Generation (2G)**:
