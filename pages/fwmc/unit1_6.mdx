# Signal Radiation & Propagation in Foundation Course in Wireless and Mobile Communication

## Signal Radiation

- **Definition**:
  - Process by which electromagnetic signals are emitted from antennas into the surrounding space.
- **Antenna Types**:
  - Omni-directional antennas radiate signals uniformly in all directions.
  - Directional antennas focus signals in specific directions for increased range or coverage.

## Signal Propagation

- **Definition**:
  - Transmission of electromagnetic signals through various mediums such as air, water, or solid objects.
- **Types**:
  - Line-of-Sight (LOS) Propagation: Signals travel directly from transmitter to receiver without obstacles.
  - Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) Propagation: Signals experience reflection, diffraction, and scattering from obstacles.
  
## Factors Affecting Propagation

- **Distance**:
  - Signal strength decreases with increasing distance due to attenuation.
- **Obstacles**:
  - Buildings, trees, and terrain can block or reflect signals, causing attenuation and multipath propagation.
- **Atmospheric Conditions**:
  - Weather conditions like rain, fog, and atmospheric disturbances can attenuate or scatter signals.
- **Frequency**:
  - Higher frequencies experience more attenuation and are more susceptible to absorption by atmospheric gases.
- **Multipath Propagation**:
  - Signals may reach the receiver via multiple paths due to reflection, diffraction, and scattering, causing interference and fading.

## Propagation Models

- **Free-Space Path Loss (FSPL)**:
  - Simple model assuming signal propagation in free space without obstacles.
- **Log-Distance Path Loss Model**:
  - Accounts for signal attenuation with distance using a logarithmic relationship.
- **Empirical Models**:
  - Derived from real-world measurements and simulations, considering various environmental factors.

## Conclusion

Understanding signal radiation and propagation is essential in wireless and mobile communication. Antennas radiate signals into the surrounding space, while propagation determines how these signals travel and are affected by various factors. Efficient propagation modeling helps in designing robust communication systems capable of reliable signal transmission in diverse environments.
