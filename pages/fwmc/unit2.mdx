# Multiplexing & Filters

## Multiplexing

### Introduction

Multiplexing is the technique of combining multiple signals or data streams into a single signal over a shared medium.

### Types of Multiplexing

1. **Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)**:
   - Divides the available bandwidth into multiple frequency channels.
   - Each channel carries a separate signal.
   - Used in radio and television broadcasting.

2. **Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)**:
   - Divides the transmission time into discrete time slots.
   - Each channel is allocated a specific time slot for transmission.
   - Commonly used in digital communication systems like T1 lines and Ethernet.

3. **Code Division Multiplexing (CDM)**:
   - Assigns a unique code to each signal to distinguish it from others.
   - Signals are transmitted simultaneously and can be separated at the receiving end using their unique codes.
   - Widely used in CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) cellular systems.

## Filters

### Introduction

Filters are electronic devices or circuits used to selectively pass or reject certain frequencies.

### Types of Filters

1. **Low-pass Filter**:
   - Allows frequencies below a certain cutoff frequency to pass through while attenuating higher frequencies.
   - Used to remove high-frequency noise and to extract the baseband signal in communication systems.

2. **High-pass Filter**:
   - Allows frequencies above a certain cutoff frequency to pass through while attenuating lower frequencies.
   - Used to remove low-frequency noise and to isolate high-frequency components in a signal.

3. **Band-pass Filter**:
   - Passes a specific range of frequencies while attenuating frequencies outside this range.
   - Commonly used in radio receivers to select a desired radio station's frequency band.

4. **Band-stop Filter (Notch Filter)**:
   - Attenuates a specific range of frequencies while passing frequencies outside this range.
   - Used to eliminate unwanted interference or noise within a specific frequency range.

Understanding and implementing multiplexing techniques and filters are essential for efficient utilization of communication channels and for ensuring signal quality in wireless and mobile communication systems.
