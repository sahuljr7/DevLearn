# Signal Transmission Concepts in Foundation Course in Wireless and Mobile Communication

## Modulation

- **Definition**:
  - Process of encoding information onto a carrier signal by varying its properties.
- **Types**:
  - Amplitude Modulation (AM)
  - Frequency Modulation (FM)
  - Phase Modulation (PM)
- **Purpose**:
  - Allows transmission of information over long distances.
  - Enables multiple signals to share the same medium.

## Demodulation

- **Definition**:
  - Process of extracting the original information from a modulated carrier signal.
- **Techniques**:
  - Envelope detection for AM signals.
  - Frequency discriminator for FM signals.
  - Phase detector for PM signals.

## Multiplexing

- **Definition**:
  - Technique for transmitting multiple signals simultaneously over a single communication channel.
- **Types**:
  - Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)
  - Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)
  - Code Division Multiplexing (CDM)

## Spread Spectrum Techniques

- **Definition**:
  - Techniques that spread the signal over a wider bandwidth than necessary for transmission.
- **Benefits**:
  - Increased resistance to interference.
  - Enhanced security against eavesdropping.
  - Allows multiple users to share the same frequency band.

## Channel Coding

- **Definition**:
  - Adding redundancy to transmitted data to detect and correct errors at the receiver.
- **Types**:
  - Forward Error Correction (FEC)
  - Convolutional Coding
  - Turbo Coding

## Error Detection and Correction

- **Definition**:
  - Techniques for detecting and correcting errors that occur during signal transmission.
- **Methods**:
  - Parity checking
  - Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
  - Hamming codes

## Conclusion

Signal transmission concepts such as modulation, demodulation, multiplexing, spread spectrum techniques, channel coding, and error detection/correction are fundamental to wireless and mobile communication systems. Understanding these concepts is essential for designing efficient and reliable communication networks capable of transmitting data over various channels with minimal errors and interference.
