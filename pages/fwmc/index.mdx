# Getting Started in Foundation Course in Wireless and Mobile Communication

## Introduction to Wireless and Mobile Communication

- **Definition**: Wireless and mobile communication refer to the transmission of information over a distance without the use of wires or cables.
- **Key Components**: 
  - Transmitters and receivers
  - Antennas
  - Modulation techniques
- **Applications**: 
  - Mobile phones
  - Wi-Fi
  - Bluetooth
  - GPS

## Basics of Communication Systems

- **Transmitter**: Device that sends signals.
- **Receiver**: Device that receives signals.
- **Channel**: Medium through which signals travel.
- **Noise**: Interference that affects signal quality.
- **Modulation**: Process of impressing data onto a carrier signal.

## Wireless Communication Technologies

- **Cellular Networks**:
  - Divided into cells, each served by a base station.
  - Examples include 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G networks.
- **Wi-Fi**:
  - Wireless local area network technology.
  - Operates in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.
- **Bluetooth**:
  - Short-range wireless technology for data exchange.
  - Commonly used in connecting peripherals to devices.
- **Satellite Communication**:
  - Utilizes satellites to relay signals over long distances.
  - Used for broadcasting, telecommunication, and navigation.

## Fundamentals of Mobile Communication

- **Mobile Network Architecture**:
  - Divided into core network and radio access network.
  - Core network handles switching and routing.
  - Radio access network connects mobile devices to the core network.
- **Handover**: Process of transferring a call or data session from one cell to another.
- **Frequency Reuse**: Technique to increase capacity by reusing frequencies in non-adjacent cells.
- **Cell Breathing**: Adjustment of cell size to accommodate varying traffic loads.

## Signal Propagation and Channel Modeling

- **Signal Propagation**:
  - Signals degrade as they travel through the medium.
  - Factors affecting propagation include distance, obstacles, and atmospheric conditions.
- **Channel Modeling**:
  - Mathematical representation of how signals behave in different environments.
  - Helps in designing efficient communication systems.
