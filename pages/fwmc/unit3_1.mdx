# Bluetooth

## Overview

Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard used for short-range communication between devices. It enables data transmission over short distances, typically up to 10 meters, without the need for cables.

## History of Bluetooth & the SIG

- **History**: Bluetooth technology was developed in the 1990s by Ericsson, and the first Bluetooth specification was released in 1999. The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) was formed to oversee the development and standardization of Bluetooth technology.
- **SIG**: The Bluetooth SIG is a consortium of companies that collaborates to develop and promote Bluetooth technology. It defines and maintains the Bluetooth specifications and certifications.

## Bluetooth Standards

- **Bluetooth Core Specifications**: The core specifications define the features, protocols, and profiles for Bluetooth communication. The latest version is Bluetooth 5.2, which includes improvements in speed, range, and reliability.

## Bluetooth Radio Interface Basics

- **Frequency Band**: Bluetooth operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) band.
- **Modulation**: Bluetooth uses Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying (GFSK) modulation to transmit data.
- **Channels**: The Bluetooth spectrum is divided into 79 channels, each 1 MHz wide.

## Bluetooth Channels and Frequencies

- **Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)**: Bluetooth employs FHSS to hop between the 79 channels in the 2.4 GHz band to avoid interference and ensure robust communication.

## Bluetooth Modulation

- **Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying (GFSK)**: Bluetooth uses GFSK modulation to encode digital data onto the carrier wave.

## Bluetooth Power Levels

- **Classes**: Bluetooth devices are classified into three power classes: Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3.
- **Transmission Range**: The power class determines the transmission range of Bluetooth devices, with Class 1 having the longest range and Class 3 the shortest.

## Bluetooth Power Level Choice and RSSI

- **Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)**: RSSI is a measure of the signal strength received by a Bluetooth device. It is used to determine the distance between devices and to optimize power level selection.

## Bluetooth Pairing

- **Pairing Process**: Pairing is the process of establishing a secure connection between two Bluetooth devices. It involves exchanging encryption keys and verifying device identities.
- **Passkey**: Pairing often requires users to enter a passkey or PIN to authenticate the connection.

## Networks of Bluetooth

- **Piconet**: A piconet is a network of Bluetooth devices, consisting of one master device and up to seven slave devices.
- **Scatternet**: A scatternet is formed when multiple piconets overlap or interconnect, allowing communication between devices in different piconets.

## Bluetooth Security

- **Encryption**: Bluetooth uses encryption to secure data transmission between devices, protecting against eavesdropping and unauthorized access.
- **Authentication**: Devices authenticate each other using pairing codes or passkeys to ensure secure connections.
