# Digital Modulation: Types and Waveforms

## Introduction

Digital modulation techniques are used to transmit digital data over a communication channel by varying certain properties of a carrier wave according to the digital signal.

## Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK)

- **Basic Principle**: Represents digital data by varying the amplitude of the carrier wave.
- **ASK Waveform**: The amplitude of the carrier wave switches between two predefined levels to encode binary data.
- **Applications**: ASK is commonly used in simple wireless communication systems and RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags.

## Frequency Shift Keying (FSK)

- **Basic Principle**: Represents digital data by varying the frequency of the carrier wave.
- **FSK Waveform**: The frequency of the carrier wave switches between two predetermined values to encode binary data.
- **Applications**: FSK is widely used in wireless communication systems, including Bluetooth and some types of cordless telephones.

## Phase Shift Keying (PSK)

- **Basic Principle**: Represents digital data by varying the phase of the carrier wave.
- **PSK Waveform**: The phase of the carrier wave changes to represent different symbols of the digital signal.
- **Applications**: PSK is utilized in various digital communication systems, including Wi-Fi, GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication), and satellite communication.

Understanding these digital modulation techniques and their associated waveforms is crucial for designing and implementing digital communication systems in wireless and mobile communication applications.
