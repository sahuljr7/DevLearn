# Testing of Hypothesis

## Procedure for Testing of Hypothesis

1. **Formulate Hypotheses**:
   - Null Hypothesis $$(H_0)$$: Represents the default assumption, usually stating no effect or no difference.
   - Alternative Hypothesis $$(H_1)$$ or $$(H_a)$$: Represents the claim or the effect we are trying to test for.

2. **Choose Significance Level(α)**:
   - The significance level $$(α)$$ determines the threshold for accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis.
   - Common values for $$(α)$$ include 0.05 and 0.01.

3. **Select Appropriate Test**:
   - Choose a statistical test based on the nature of the data and the research question.

4. **Collect Data and Compute Test Statistic**:
   - Collect relevant data and compute the test statistic based on the chosen test.

5. **Determine Critical Value or P-value**:
   - Based on the significance level and the chosen test, determine the critical value from the appropriate distribution or compute the p-value.

6. **Make Decision**:
   - Compare the test statistic with the critical value or p-value.
   - If the test statistic falls in the rejection region (critical region) or if the p-value is less than $$(α)$$, reject the null hypothesis.
   - Otherwise, fail to reject the null hypothesis.

## Tests of Significance for Large Samples

- **Z-test**:
  - Used when the sample size is large (typically $$( n \geq 30 )$$).
  - Compares a sample mean or proportion to a population mean or proportion.

## t-test

- **t-test**:
  - Used when the sample size is small (typically $$( n < 30 )$$) and the population standard deviation is unknown.
  - Compares means of two independent samples (independent t-test) or a single sample mean to a known value (one-sample t-test).

## Chi-square Test

- **Chi-square test**:
  - Used for categorical data analysis to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables.
  - Common types include:
    - **Chi-square test of independence**: Tests whether two categorical variables are independent.
    - **Chi-square goodness-of-fit test**: Tests whether observed frequencies match expected frequencies.
