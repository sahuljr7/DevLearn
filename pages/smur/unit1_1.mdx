# Arithmetic Mean

## Definition

- The arithmetic mean is a measure of central tendency that represents the average of a dataset.
- It is calculated by summing all values in the dataset and dividing by the total number of values.

## Calculation in R

- In R, the arithmetic mean can be calculated using the `mean()` function.
- This function takes a vector of numeric values as input and returns their arithmetic mean.

## Properties

- The arithmetic mean is sensitive to outliers in the data.
- It is affected by extreme values, which can skew the result.
- The arithmetic mean is widely used in various fields for its simplicity and interpretability.

## Interpretation

- The arithmetic mean provides a single value that summarizes the central tendency of a dataset.
- It is suitable for symmetrically distributed data without significant outliers.
- However, it may not accurately represent the central tendency if the data is skewed or contains outliers.

## Example

```r
# Sample dataset
data <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

# Calculate the arithmetic mean
mean_value <- mean(data)
print(mean_value)
```

In this example, the arithmetic mean of the dataset `{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}` is calculated to be `30`.
