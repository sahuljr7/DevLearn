### What is R?

R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is widely used in various fields, including data mining, bioinformatics, and data analysis, due to its powerful capabilities in statistical computing and data visualization. R is open-source and free software, licensed by the GNU Project under the GNU General Public License.

The core R language is augmented by a large number of extension packages, which contain reusable code, documentation, and sample data. R software is written primarily in C, Fortran, and R itself, and it is available for various operating systems, including arm64 and x86-64. R has a native command line interface and supports multiple third-party graphical user interfaces, such as RStudio and Jupyter.

R was started by professors Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman as a programming language to teach introductory statistics at the University of Auckland. The name "R" comes from being both an S language successor and the shared first letter of the authors, Ross and Robert. R became a GNU project in 1997 and released its first official 1.0 version in 2000.

R is known for its steep learning curve, but its benefits far exceed the effort invested, especially when combined with learning or repeating statistics. It is a powerful tool for statistical data processing, including frequentist statistics, Bayesian statistics, meta-analysis, machine and deep learning, parallel computing, and Big Data processing. R is also a social and subcultural phenomenon, with packages made by users themselves and shared through CRAN, the official and unofficial user forums and networks, and The R Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to the continued development of R.

In summary, R is a powerful and versatile programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics, widely used in various fields and supported by a large community of users and developers. It is open-source, free software, and available for various operating systems. R's steep learning curve is offset by its benefits, making it a valuable tool for statistical data processing and analysis.
