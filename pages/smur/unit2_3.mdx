# Bernoulli Distribution

## Definition
- A Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution of a random variable which takes the value 1 with probability 𝑝 and the value 0 with probability 1−𝑝, where 0 ≤ 𝑝 ≤ 1

## Notation
- X∼Bernoulli(p), where 𝑝 is the probability of success.

## Parameters
- p: Probability of success (0 for failure, 1 for success)

## Probability Mass Function (PMF)
- $$P(X = 1)$$ = $$p$$
- $$P(X = 0)$$ = $$1−p$$

## Mean and Variance
- Mean $$(𝜇)$$ = $$𝑝$$
- Variance $$(σ^2)$$ = $$p(1-p)$$

## Applications
- Modeling binary outcomes like success/failure, heads/tails, etc.
- Used in various fields including finance, medicine, and engineering.

## Example
- Flipping a coin where "heads" is success (1) and "tails" is failure (0).

## R Functions
- `rbernoulli()`: Generates random samples from a Bernoulli distribution.
- `pbernoulli()`: Calculates cumulative probabilities.
- `qbernoulli()`: Calculates quantiles.
- `dbernoulli()`: Evaluates the probability mass function.

## Properties
- Independent trials: Outcomes of each trial are independent.
- Two possible outcomes: Success (1) or failure (0).
- Simplest form of a discrete probability distribution.

## Limitations
- Only applicable to situations with binary outcomes.
- Assumes independence between trials.
