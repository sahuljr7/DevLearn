# Median

## Definition

- The median is a measure of central tendency that represents the middle value of a dataset when it is ordered from least to greatest.
- It divides the dataset into two equal parts.

## Calculation in R

- In R, the median can be calculated using the `median()` function.
- This function takes a vector of numeric values as input and returns their median.

## Properties

- The median is robust to outliers in the data, making it suitable for skewed distributions.
- It is not influenced by extreme values as much as the arithmetic mean.

## Interpretation

- The median provides a more accurate representation of central tendency when the data is skewed or contains outliers.
- It is particularly useful when analyzing non-normally distributed data.

## Example

```r
# Sample dataset
data <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

# Calculate the median
median_value <- median(data)
print(median_value)
```

In this example, the median of the dataset `{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}` is calculated to be `30`.
