# Area Under the Normal Curve

## Definition
- The area under the Normal curve represents the probability of a random variable falling within a certain range of values in a Normal distribution.

## Characteristics
- The total area under the Normal curve is equal to 1.
- The area to the left of a specific value \( x \) represents the cumulative probability up to that value.

## Standard Normal Distribution
- A special case of the Normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 is called the Standard Normal distribution.
- Z-scores are used to represent values in the Standard Normal distribution.

## Calculating Areas
- The area under the Normal curve can be calculated using statistical software or standard Normal tables.
- Statistical functions in R, such as `pnorm()`, are commonly used to find cumulative probabilities.

## Interpretation
- The area under the curve between two points represents the probability that a randomly selected value falls within that range.

## Applications
- Used in hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and various statistical analyses to determine probabilities of events occurring within certain ranges.

## Example
- Finding the probability that a randomly selected individual's height falls between two specific values in a population with a Normal distribution of heights.
