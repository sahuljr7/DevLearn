# Measures of Central Tendency: Arithmetic Mean, Median, Mode

## Arithmetic Mean

- **Definition:**
  - The arithmetic mean is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the total number of values.

- **Calculation in R:**
  - Use the `mean()` function to calculate the arithmetic mean in R.

- **Usage:**
  - It is commonly used to represent the average value of a dataset.

## Median

- **Definition:**
  - The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is ordered from least to greatest.
  - If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.

- **Calculation in R:**
  - Use the `median()` function to calculate the median in R.

- **Usage:**
  - The median is robust to outliers and is often used when the data is skewed or contains outliers.

## Mode

- **Definition:**
  - The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.
  - A dataset can have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more (multimodal).

- **Calculation in R:**
  - There is no built-in function for mode calculation in R. However, custom functions or packages like `dplyr` can be used.

- **Usage:**
  - The mode is useful for categorical or nominal data.
  - It is less commonly used for continuous data compared to mean and median.

## Conclusion

Measures of central tendency, including arithmetic mean, median, and mode, are essential tools in statistics for summarizing and understanding datasets. Each measure provides insight into different aspects of the data distribution and is used in various contexts depending on the nature of the data and the analysis requirements. In R, these measures can be easily calculated using built-in functions, facilitating efficient data analysis and interpretation.
