## Concise History of ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation)

ISRO was formed in 1969, superseding the Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) which had been set up in 1962 at the recommendation of Dr. Vikram Sarabhai. ISRO was established with an expanded role to harness space technology for India's development.

In 1972, the Government of India set up the Department of Space (DOS) and the Space Commission, bringing ISRO under DOS's purview. This institutionalized space research activities in India and forged the Indian space program into its existing form.

ISRO's early achievements included launching India's first satellite Aryabhata in 1975 with Soviet assistance. In 1980, ISRO launched the Rohini satellite using the indigenously developed Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV), making India the sixth nation to launch a satellite with its own rocket.

Over the following decades, ISRO developed increasingly advanced satellite and launch vehicle technologies. Key milestones included the development of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV). ISRO also established major space systems for communication, remote sensing, navigation and meteorology.

ISRO has conducted interplanetary missions to the Moon (Chandrayaan) and Mars. It has also developed applications of space technology for societal benefits in areas like telemedicine, tele-education, weather forecasting, disaster management and more.

Today, ISRO is one of the six government space agencies in the world with full launch capabilities and a large fleet of satellites. Its programs have played a significant role in India's development and space diplomacy.

The history of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is a story of remarkable progress and achievements, transforming India into a major player in the global space community.
