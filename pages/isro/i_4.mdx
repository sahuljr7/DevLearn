# What are the key features of ISRO's reusable launch vehicle technology?

## Key Features of ISRO's RLV-TD

- The RLV-TD is designed to look like an aircraft, with a fuselage, nose cap, double delta wings, and twin vertical tails. 

- It features symmetrically placed active control surfaces called Elevons and Rudder. 

- The RLV-TD is boosted to Mach 5 speeds by a conventional solid booster (HS9) designed for low burn rate. 

- ISRO has utilized specialized materials like alloys, composites, and insulation to develop the RLV-TD. 

## Key Achievements of ISRO's RLV Program

- ISRO has successfully demonstrated the autonomous landing capability of the RLV-TD through a series of Landing Experiment (LEX) missions. 

- The latest LEX-03 mission in 2023 simulated high-speed landing conditions of over 320 km/h, showcasing ISRO's expertise in critical reusable launch vehicle technologies. 

- The LEX-03 mission reused the winged body and flight systems from the previous LEX-02 mission, demonstrating ISRO's capability to reuse flight systems. 

- The RLV-TD program has validated advanced guidance algorithms for longitudinal and lateral plane error corrections, essential for future orbital re-entry missions. 

- ISRO's RLV-TD program, though smaller in scale compared to some global peers, represents a significant step for India in developing reusable launch vehicle technology to enable low-cost access to space.
