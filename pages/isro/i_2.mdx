# What are the key achievements of ISRO in space exploration?

## Chandrayaan Missions

- **Chandrayaan-3 (2023)**: Successfully soft-landed on the Moon's south pole, making India the first country to achieve this feat. It was the fourth country globally to accomplish a soft landing on the Moon.

- **Chandrayaan-2 (2019)**: Attempted a soft landing on the Moon but lost contact with the lander. However, the orbiter is still operational and has captured high-resolution images of the lunar surface.

- **Chandrayaan-1 (2008)**: India's first lunar exploration mission that successfully orbited the Moon and made significant discoveries about the lunar surface.

## Mars Orbiter Mission (Mangalyaan)

- **Mangalyaan (2014)**: India's first interplanetary mission that successfully entered Mars orbit, making India the first country to do so in its maiden attempt. It has been studying the Martian atmosphere and surface for over 8 years.

## Launch Capabilities

- **PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle)**: ISRO's workhorse launch vehicle that has successfully launched 104 satellites in a single mission, setting a world record in 2017.

- **GSLV (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle)**: Capable of launching heavier satellites into orbit, GSLV has enabled ISRO to become self-reliant in launching communication satellites.

## Communication and Earth Observation Satellites

- **INSAT (Indian National Satellite) System**: One of the largest domestic communication satellite systems in the Asia-Pacific region, providing services for telecommunications, television transmission, weather forecasting, and disaster warning.

- **IRS (Indian Remote Sensing) Satellites**: A series of Earth observation satellites that provide data for management of natural resources and disaster management.

## International Collaborations

- **Collaborated with over 100 countries** for satellite launches and space exploration missions.

- **Launched satellites for 34 foreign countries** as a commercial service.

These achievements have firmly established ISRO as a key player in the global space community and a pioneer in affordable space exploration.
