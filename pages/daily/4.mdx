The latest amendment to the Indian Constitution is the Constitution (105th Amendment) Act, 2021. It was introduced on August 9, 2021 by Dr. Virendra Kumar, the Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment[1].

The key changes made by the 105th Amendment are:

## Redefining Powers of States for Identifying OBCs

- It amends clauses 1 and 2 of Article 342A and introduces clause 3[1].
- The amendment clarifies that states can prepare and maintain their own lists of socially and educationally backward classes (SEBCs), also known as Other Backward Classes (OBCs)[1].
- This addresses the ambiguity created by the 102nd Amendment which had defined the scope of the Central List of OBCs but did not specify the role of state governments in declaring communities as backward[1].

## Changes to Articles 338B and 366

- The 105th Amendment also brings changes to Articles 338B (9) and 366 (26C)[1].
- Article 338B is about the National Commission for Backward Classes.
- Article 366 contains definitions, with 26C defining "socially and educationally backward classes".

In summary, the 105th Amendment restores the power of states to identify OBCs, which was earlier taken away by the 102nd Amendment. It clarifies the respective roles of the Centre and states in maintaining the OBC list[1].
