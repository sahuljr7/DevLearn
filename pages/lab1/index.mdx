| 1.1    | Write a program to configure a small Hadoop cluster with at least one master and two worker nodes.          | 15 Hours          |
| 1.2    | Write a program for Map Reduce to analyze a dataset and understand the Map Reduce workflow with execution on the Hadoop cluster. | CO1               |
| 1.3    | Write a program to interact with HDFS using the Hadoop File System API. Create a new file, write some content to it, and then read and display the content from the file. | CO2               |
| 1.4    | Write a Python program using Apache Spark to process a large dataset.                                       | CO2               |

## Unit-2

| 2.1    | Write a Python program using the PyMongo library to connect to a MongoDB instance. Create a new database and a collection, insert multiple documents into the collection, and then query and display the documents. | CO3               |
| 2.2    | Write a program in python to model a sample dataset for a social networking application in a NoSQL database. | CO3               |
| 2.3    | Write a Python program using a suitable NoSQL driver (e.g., pymongo for MongoDB) to perform data migration from a CSV file to a NoSQL database. | CO3               |

## Unit-3

| 3.1    | Write a program using MLlib to perform predictive analytics on a large dataset. Choose a suitable machine-learning algorithm to predict a target variable. | CO5               |
| 3.2    | Write a Python program using a machine learning library (e.g., scikit-learn) to perform feature engineering and evaluate a predictive model. | CO5               |
| 3.3    | Write a program to design a prescriptive analytics solution for one of the real-world case studies (Walmart, Uber, Netflix, or eBay). | CO4               |
