# Object-Oriented Features

## Introduction
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications and computer programs.
- Java is an object-oriented programming language, meaning it emphasizes the use of objects and classes.

## Main Object-Oriented Features
1. **Encapsulation**
2. **Inheritance**
3. **Polymorphism**
4. **Abstraction**

## Encapsulation
- **Definition**: Wrapping data (fields) and code (methods) into a single unit (class).
- **Access Control**: Use private fields and public getter/setter methods.
- **Benefits**: 
  - Protects data integrity.
  - Hides the internal implementation details.
  - Promotes modularity.

## Inheritance
- **Definition**: Mechanism where one class (subclass) inherits fields and methods from another class (superclass).
- **Syntax**: `class SubClass extends SuperClass { ... }`
- **Types**:
  - **Single Inheritance**: One superclass, one subclass.
  - **Hierarchical Inheritance**: One superclass, multiple subclasses.
- **Benefits**:
  - Promotes code reusability.
  - Establishes a natural hierarchy.

## Polymorphism
- **Definition**: Ability of an object to take many forms.
- **Types**:
  - **Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)**:
    - Same method name, different parameters.
    - Example: 
      ```java
      void display() { ... }
      void display(int x) { ... }
      ```
  - **Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)**:
    - Subclass provides specific implementation of a method declared in its superclass.
    - Example:
      ```java
      @Override
      void display() { ... }
      ```
- **Benefits**:
  - Increases the flexibility and scalability of code.
  - Promotes dynamic method resolution at runtime.

## Abstraction
- **Definition**: Hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
- **Techniques**:
  - **Abstract Classes**:
    - Cannot be instantiated.
    - Can have abstract methods (without body) and concrete methods.
    - Example:
      ```java
      abstract class Animal {
          abstract void sound();
      }
      ```
  - **Interfaces**:
    - Contains method signatures without bodies.
    - A class implements an interface to provide the method bodies.
    - Example:
      ```java
      interface Animal {
          void sound();
      }
      ```

## Key Benefits of OOP
- **Modularity**: Breaking down the program into smaller, manageable pieces (classes).
- **Reusability**: Reusing existing code through inheritance.
- **Scalability**: Easily extendable code with new features or changes.
- **Maintainability**: Easier to manage and update due to well-structured code.

Understanding these core object-oriented features in Java is essential for creating robust, maintainable, and scalable software applications.
