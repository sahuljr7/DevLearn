## Java 8

Java 8 is a version of the Java programming language and platform released by Oracle Corporation in March 2014. It introduced several significant features and enhancements to the Java language, runtime environment, and standard library. Some of the key features introduced in Java 8 include:

1. **Lambda Expressions:** Lambda expressions provide a concise syntax for writing anonymous functions, enabling developers to write more expressive and flexible code.

2. **Stream API:** The Stream API allows for functional-style operations on collections of elements, enabling parallel execution, and simplifying code for processing collections.

3. **Default Methods:** Default methods enable the addition of new methods to interfaces in a backwards-compatible manner, allowing interfaces to evolve without breaking existing implementations.

4. **Optional class:** The Optional class provides a way to express that a value may be absent, reducing the need for null checks and improving code clarity.

5. **Date and Time API:** Java 8 introduced a new Date and Time API, known as `java.time`, which provides a more comprehensive and flexible approach to date and time manipulation compared to the previous `Date` and `Calendar` classes.

6. **Nashorn JavaScript Engine:** Java 8 includes the Nashorn JavaScript engine, which allows developers to execute JavaScript code from within Java applications.

7. **Parallel Array Sorting:** Java 8 introduced parallel sorting algorithms, improving the performance of sorting large arrays by utilizing multiple cores.

Overall, Java 8 brought significant improvements to the Java language and platform, making it more expressive, concise, and capable of handling modern programming challenges.
