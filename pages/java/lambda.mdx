## Lambda Expressions in Java 8

Lambda expressions in Java 8 provide a concise syntax for writing anonymous functions, enabling developers to write more expressive and flexible code. They are particularly useful in functional programming paradigms and can be used in various contexts, such as with the Stream API for processing collections.

Lambda expressions consist of parameters, an arrow (->), and a body. They allow for the creation of functions without the need for explicit method definitions. For example:

```java
// Traditional anonymous class
button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        System.out.println("Button clicked");
    }
});

// Using lambda expression
button.addActionListener(e -> System.out.println("Button clicked"));
```

Lambda expressions are especially beneficial when working with interfaces that have a single abstract method, such as functional interfaces. They promote cleaner and more readable code by reducing boilerplate code and focusing on the core logic.

In summary, Lambda expressions introduced in Java 8 offer a powerful tool for writing concise and expressive code, particularly in functional programming scenarios.
