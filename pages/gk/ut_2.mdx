## History of Chandigarh City

Chandigarh, often referred to as "The City Beautiful," is a unique and significant city in India due to its modernist architecture, urban planning, and historical background. Here is a detailed overview of its history:

#### Pre-Independence Era
1. **Ancient Period**: The region that Chandigarh now occupies was historically part of the Punjab region and has evidence of settlements dating back to the Harappan civilization (c. 2600â€“1900 BCE). Archaeological findings suggest it was inhabited during ancient times.

2. **Medieval Period**: The area was under various rulers over the centuries, including the Mauryas, Guptas, Mughals, and the Sikh Empire. It was not a significant urban center during this time, primarily being an agrarian landscape.

#### Post-Independence and Formation
3. **Partition of India (1947)**:
   - **Context**: The partition of India in 1947 led to the division of the Punjab province between India and Pakistan. The capital of Punjab, Lahore, went to Pakistan, leaving the Indian Punjab without a capital.
   - **Need for a New Capital**: To fill this gap, the Indian government decided to build a new, modern city to serve as the capital of Punjab.

4. **Planning and Development**:
   - **Selection of Site**: The site for Chandigarh was selected in 1948 at the foothills of the Shivalik range in the Himalayas, a location that was considered optimal due to its geography and climate.
   - **Albert Mayer and Matthew Nowicki**: Initially, American planner Albert Mayer and Polish architect Matthew Nowicki were commissioned to design the city. Mayer's plans emphasized garden cities with green spaces and self-contained neighborhoods. After Nowicki's untimely death in 1950, the project required a new lead architect.
   - **Le Corbusier's Vision**: The renowned Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier was brought in to redesign the city. He is credited with giving Chandigarh its distinctive, modernist style. Le Corbusier's plan focused on functionality, geometric planning, and separation of different areas for living, working, and recreation.

5. **Design and Architecture**:
   - **The Capitol Complex**: One of Le Corbusier's masterpieces, it includes the High Court, Secretariat, and Legislative Assembly buildings, showcasing his signature brutalist style.
   - **Sector Layout**: Chandigarh is divided into sectors, each designed to be self-sufficient with residential areas, markets, schools, and healthcare facilities.
   - **Green Spaces**: The city is known for its extensive parks and gardens, including the famous Rock Garden and Sukhna Lake, contributing to its reputation as a green city.

#### Post-Formation Development
6. **Growth and Administration**:
   - **Union Territory**: In 1966, when the state of Punjab was reorganized to create Haryana, Chandigarh was declared a union territory and serves as the capital of both Punjab and Haryana.
   - **Urban Expansion**: Over the decades, Chandigarh has grown beyond its original plan, incorporating new sectors and urban extensions to accommodate the increasing population and commercial activities.

7. **Cultural and Educational Hub**:
   - **Educational Institutions**: Chandigarh is home to several prestigious institutions, including Panjab University, the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), and the Punjab Engineering College.
   - **Cultural Influence**: The city has a vibrant cultural scene with theaters, museums, and art galleries. It hosts various cultural events, including music festivals, art exhibitions, and literary gatherings.
