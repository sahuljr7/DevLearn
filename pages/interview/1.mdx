### 5. What are semantic elements in HTML?

**Answer:** Semantic elements are those that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way.

### 6. What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute in images?

### 7. What is the difference between `<script>`, `<script async>`, and `<script defer>`?

**Answer:**
- `<script>`: Loads and executes the script immediately, blocking HTML parsing until it is downloaded and executed.
- `<script async>`: Loads the script asynchronously while continuing to parse the HTML. The script executes as soon as it is available, possibly before the page has finished parsing.
- `<script defer>`: Loads the script asynchronously while continuing to parse the HTML. The script executes only after the HTML parsing is complete.

**Answer:**
- **Block-level elements**: They start on a new line and take up the full width available (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>` - `<h6>`).
- **Inline elements**: They do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary (e.g., `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`).

  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
