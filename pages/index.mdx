Hi there! I'm Sahul. I am a 4th Year Undergraduate Student pursuing CSE at Chandigarh University. In my spare time I do open-sourcing. Most of my open-source projects are focused on one thing â€“ to help people learn. You may use these projects to learn about algorithms in JavaScript and get prepared for technical interviews, etc. I also write articles about life, technology, web-development and blockchain.

This is my self-coded website built from scratch. It is all about learning and exploring new things together.

Feel free to get in touch with me for any inquiries or assistance. I am here to help!
