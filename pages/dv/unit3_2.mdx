# Google Maps API

## Introduction
The Google Maps API provides developers with access to Google Maps data and functionality, allowing them to integrate maps and location-based services into their applications.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Maps Embed API
- **Definition:** Allows developers to embed interactive Google Maps directly into web pages with a simple HTML snippet.
- **Usage:** Enables the integration of maps into websites and applications without requiring extensive programming knowledge.

### 2. Maps JavaScript API
- **Definition:** Provides JavaScript functions and objects for creating and manipulating interactive maps on web pages.
- **Usage:** Allows developers to customize map appearance, add markers, overlays, and controls, and handle user interactions.

### 3. Places API
- **Definition:** Allows developers to retrieve information about places, such as businesses, landmarks, and geographic features, based on user queries or location.
- **Usage:** Enables integration of location-based search and information retrieval into applications, such as finding nearby restaurants or points of interest.

### 4. Geocoding API
- **Definition:** Converts addresses or place names into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) and vice versa.
- **Usage:** Allows developers to geocode addresses for mapping and location-based services and reverse geocode coordinates to obtain address information.

### 5. Directions API
- **Definition:** Provides routing and navigation functionality, allowing developers to calculate directions between locations and retrieve step-by-step instructions.
- **Usage:** Enables integration of route planning and navigation features into applications, such as mapping out driving directions or finding public transit routes.

### 6. Street View API
- **Definition:** Allows developers to embed interactive panoramic street-level views into web pages or applications.
- **Usage:** Provides immersive street-level experiences for users to explore locations and surroundings virtually.
