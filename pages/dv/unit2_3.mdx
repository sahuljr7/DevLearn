# Linked Views for Visual Exploration

## Introduction
Linked views for visual exploration refer to a technique where multiple visualizations are interconnected, allowing users to explore and analyze data from different perspectives simultaneously.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Linked Views
- **Definition:** A set of visualizations that are interconnected, typically by sharing data or interactive features.
- **Usage:** Enabling users to interactively explore data from various angles and uncover insights more effectively.

### 2. Coordination
- **Definition:** The synchronization of interactions across linked views, ensuring that actions in one view affect others.
- **Usage:** Allowing users to select data points, filter data, or manipulate visualizations in one view and observe the corresponding changes in other linked views.

### 3. Brushing and Linking
- **Definition:** Techniques that enable users to select or highlight data points in one visualization and observe corresponding data points in linked visualizations.
- **Usage:** Facilitating the exploration of relationships and patterns across multiple views by focusing on specific subsets of data.

### 4. Dynamic Filtering
- **Definition:** The ability to dynamically filter data displayed in one visualization based on selections or interactions in another visualization.
- **Usage:** Allowing users to refine their analysis by iteratively adjusting filters and observing the impact on linked views.

### 5. Cross-Filtering
- **Definition:** The process of applying filters based on selections made in one visualization to other linked visualizations, restricting data displayed in those views.
- **Usage:** Supporting interactive exploration of data relationships and dependencies by dynamically updating multiple views based on user interactions.

## Importance of Linked Views for Visual Exploration
- Enhance interactive data exploration by providing multiple perspectives on the same dataset.
- Enable users to identify patterns, correlations, and outliers more effectively by comparing different visual representations.
- Support iterative analysis and hypothesis testing by allowing users to interactively manipulate and refine visualizations.
- Facilitate collaborative data analysis and decision-making processes by enabling users to share insights gained from linked views.
