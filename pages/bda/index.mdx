# Getting Started with Big Data Analytics

## What is Big Data Analytics?

- **Definition**: Big Data Analytics involves the process of examining large and varied data sets to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations, market trends, customer preferences, and other useful business information.
- **Goal**: Extract actionable insights from vast amounts of data to drive informed decision-making.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Big Data

- **Volume**: Refers to the vast amount of data generated from various sources like social media, sensors, devices, etc.
- **Velocity**: Describes the speed at which data is generated and needs to be processed in real-time or near real-time.
- **Variety**: Denotes the diversity of data types and sources, including structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data.

### 2. Analytics

- **Descriptive Analytics**: Focuses on summarizing historical data to understand past trends and events.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Involves forecasting future trends and outcomes based on historical data and statistical algorithms.
- **Prescriptive Analytics**: Recommends actions to optimize outcomes based on predictive models and decision-making rules.

### 3. Technologies

- **Hadoop**: An open-source framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets across clusters of computers.
- **Spark**: A fast and general-purpose cluster computing system for big data processing, offering in-memory computation and versatility.
- **NoSQL Databases**: Non-relational databases designed for large-scale data storage and real-time applications.
- **Machine Learning**: Algorithms and techniques used to train models to analyze and make predictions from data.
