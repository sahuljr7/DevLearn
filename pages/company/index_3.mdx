## Experience 1

1. **Tell me about yourself.**
   - **Answer:** I am a fourth-year Computer Science Engineering student at Chandigarh University. I have a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, and C#. I enjoy solving complex problems and have worked on various projects involving web and mobile app development. I am also an active participant in coding clubs and hackathons.

2. **What is C#?**
   - **Answer:** C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is used to build a variety of applications, especially on the .NET platform.

3. **What is the OOP concept?**
   - **Answer:** Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects. The main principles are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

4. **What is a delegate?**
   - **Answer:** A delegate is a type in C# that represents references to methods with a specific parameter list and return type. It is used to pass methods as arguments to other methods.

5. **What is polymorphism and what are its types?**
   - **Answer:** Polymorphism is the ability of a single function or method to work in different ways based on the input. Its types are:
     - Compile-time (method overloading)
     - Run-time (method overriding)

6. **What is the difference between polymorphism and inheritance?**
   - **Answer:** Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, while inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.

7. **What is the `out` keyword in C#?**
   - **Answer:** The `out` keyword in C# is used to pass arguments to methods by reference. It allows a method to return multiple values.

8. **What is the `ref` keyword in C#?**
   - **Answer:** The `ref` keyword in C# is used to pass an argument by reference, meaning any changes to the parameter in the method will be reflected in that variable when control returns to the calling method.

9. **What is the difference between `call by reference` and `call by value`?**
   - **Answer:** In `call by value`, a copy of the variable is passed to the method, so changes do not affect the original variable. In `call by reference`, the actual variable is passed, so changes affect the original variable.

10. **What is a namespace?**
    - **Answer:** A namespace is a container that holds classes, interfaces, enums, and other namespaces, helping to organize code and prevent naming conflicts.

11. **What is data hiding?**
    - **Answer:** Data hiding is an OOP concept that restricts access to the internal state of an object, typically using access modifiers like private and protected.

12. **What is abstraction?**
    - **Answer:** Abstraction is an OOP concept that hides the complex implementation details of a system and exposes only the necessary parts.

13. **What is the difference between DBMS and RDBMS?**
    - **Answer:** DBMS (Database Management System) is software for storing and managing data. RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) is a type of DBMS that stores data in tables and supports relationships between tables.

14. **What is the difference between `DROP` and `TRUNCATE`? Can we use `ROLLBACK` for `DROP`?**
    - **Answer:** `DROP` removes a table and its data from the database. `TRUNCATE` deletes all data in a table but keeps the table structure. `ROLLBACK` cannot be used for `DROP`, as it is a DDL command and is not reversible.

15. **Can we use pointers in C#?**
    - **Answer:** Yes, C# supports pointers, but only in an unsafe context.

16. **What is managed code and unmanaged code?**
    - **Answer:** Managed code is executed by the .NET runtime environment, which provides services like garbage collection. Unmanaged code is executed directly by the operating system, without such services.

17. **What are joins and what are the types of joins?**
    - **Answer:** Joins are SQL operations used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. Types include:
      - Inner Join
      - Left Join
      - Right Join
      - Full Join

18. **What is a cross join?**
    - **Answer:** A cross join returns the Cartesian product of two tables, meaning it combines all rows from the first table with all rows from the second table.

19. **What is the difference between a stored procedure (SP) and a function?**
    - **Answer:** A stored procedure can perform actions like modifying data and does not need to return a value. A function must return a value and can be used in SQL statements like a scalar value.

20. **What is a primary key?**
    - **Answer:** A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table. It ensures that each record is unique and not null.

21. **What is a foreign key?**
    - **Answer:** A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a table that provides a link between data in two tables. It ensures referential integrity by referencing the primary key of another table.

### Comparing Programming Languages
**What is the difference between C++ and Java?**
- **Answer:** 
  - **C++:** Supports both procedural and object-oriented programming, uses pointers, and requires manual memory management.
  - **Java:** Purely object-oriented, uses automatic garbage collection, and does not support pointers.

**The difference between call by value and call by reference with syntax**
- **Answer:**
  - **Call by Value:** Passes a copy of the value to the function.
    ```cpp
    void func(int x) {
      x = 10;
    }
    int main() {
      int a = 5;
      func(a); // a remains 5
    }
    ```
  - **Call by Reference:** Passes the actual variable, allowing modifications.
    ```cpp
    void func(int &x) {
      x = 10;
    }
    int main() {
      int a = 5;
      func(a); // a becomes 10
    }
    ```

### Coding
**Write a code to find the factorial of a number**
- **Answer:**
  ```python
  def factorial(n):
      if n == 0:
          return 1
      else:
          return n * factorial(n - 1)
  
  number = 5
  print(f"The factorial of {number} is {factorial(number)}")
  ```
