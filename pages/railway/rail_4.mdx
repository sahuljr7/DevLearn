# Structure of Indian Railways

The structure of Indian Railways is organized into a comprehensive hierarchy that facilitates efficient management and operations. Here are the key components of this structure:

### Railway Board
- **Composition**: The Railway Board is the highest decision-making body, consisting of a chairman and four other members responsible for operations, business development, human resources, infrastructure, and finance. The chairman reports to the Ministry of Railways.
  
- **Responsibilities**: The board oversees the functioning of various zones, divisions, production units, and public sector undertakings (PSUs) under Indian Railways.

### Zones and Divisions
- **Zones**: Indian Railways is divided into 18 administrative zones (17 operational), each headed by a General Manager. These zones are semi-autonomous and manage their respective operations and resources.

- **Divisions**: Each zone is further subdivided into 71 operating divisions, managed by Divisional Railway Managers (DRMs). Divisions handle the day-to-day operations, maintenance, and administration of railway services within their geographical area.

### Functional Groups
- **Departments**: The organization is structured into various functional groups, including:
  - **Traction**
  - **Engineering**
  - **Traffic**
  - **Rolling Stock**
  - **Signaling**
  - **Materials**
  - **Personnel**
  - **Finance**
  - **Health and Safety**

- **Head of Departments (HODs)**: Each zone has HODs for these functional areas, who report to the General Manager and coordinate with divisional staff.

### Employee Classification
- **Gazetted Employees**: These include Groups A and B, who perform executive and managerial tasks. They constitute about 1.5% of the total workforce. Group A employees are primarily recruited through the Indian Railways Management Service (IRMS) and other competitive examinations.

- **Non-Gazetted Employees**: Groups C and D account for approximately 98.5% of the workforce. Group C employees are recruited through examinations conducted by the Railway Recruitment Control Board (RRCB), while Group D staff are recruited by zonal Railway Recruitment Cells (RRC).

### Training and Development
- Indian Railways operates seven centralized training institutes and 295 training centers to ensure continuous skill development and training for its employees.

### Control and Coordination
- **Control Rooms**: Each division has control rooms responsible for monitoring train operations and coordinating between different departments to ensure smooth functioning.

### Subsidiaries and Public Sector Undertakings
- Indian Railways manages various PSUs and organizations related to rail transport, such as the Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC), RailTel Corporation, and the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC).

This structured approach enables Indian Railways to effectively manage its extensive operations, ensuring safety, efficiency, and service delivery across its vast network.

## How are employees classified into different groups in Indian Railways?

Employees in Indian Railways are classified into different groups based on their roles and responsibilities. The classification is primarily divided into two categories: **gazetted** and **non-gazetted** employees.

### Gazetted Employees
These employees carry out executive and managerial tasks and are further divided into:

- **Group A**: 
  - Comprises about 1.5% of the total workforce.
  - Recruitment is primarily through the Indian Railways Management Service (IRMS), with some positions filled through promotions.
  - Group A includes various cadres such as:
    - Central Civil Services (through Civil Services Examination)
    - Central Engineering Services (through Engineering Services Examination)
    - Central Health Science Services (through Combined Medical Services Examination)

- **Group B**: 
  - Also part of the gazetted category, Group B employees are typically promoted from Group C employees through departmental exams.

### Non-Gazetted Employees
This category constitutes about 98.5% of the workforce and is divided into:

- **Group C**: 
  - Recruitment is conducted through examinations by the Railway Recruitment Control Board (RRCB).
  - Group C employees perform various operational, technical, and administrative roles.

- **Group D**: 
  - These employees are recruited by zonal Railway Recruitment Cells (RRC).
  - Group D positions typically involve support and maintenance tasks.

### Summary of Employee Classification
- **Group A**: Executive/managerial roles (1.5% of workforce)
- **Group B**: Promoted from Group C, also in managerial roles
- **Group C**: Operational and technical roles (majority of workforce)
- **Group D**: Support roles (largest group)

This structured classification helps in managing the extensive workforce of Indian Railways efficiently, ensuring that various operational and administrative tasks are carried out effectively [1][2].
