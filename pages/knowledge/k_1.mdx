## network effect principle

The network effect principle, in simple words, means that the value of a product or service increases as more people use it. Here's a straightforward explanation:

When a product or service has a network effect, it means that each new user of the product adds value to the existing users. This is because the more people who use the product, the more useful and attractive it becomes to others. 

For example:
- **Social Media**: The more users join a social media platform like Facebook or Instagram, the more content there is to engage with, making the platform more valuable to all users.
- **Messaging Apps**: Apps like WhatsApp or WeChat become more useful as more people join because users can connect with a larger network of contacts.
- **Marketplaces**: Platforms like eBay or Airbnb become more valuable as more sellers and buyers join, providing a wider selection of goods and services.

In essence, the network effect principle explains why some products or services become more popular and dominant in their markets over time.
